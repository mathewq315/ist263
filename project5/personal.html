    <h2>Mixing Music</h2>
    <p>
      This was a hobby I picked up my sophomore year of college. I was introduced to the activity when my
      sister learned the basics while she was in college. I borrowed her equipment over breaks when visiting
      California. It was hard to understand at first as I did not have any background in music. It was even a
      little daunting at first with all the buttons, switches, and knobs. I decided to I enjoyed it enough to
      follow through with the hobby and purchase my own equipment. Living outside of Los Angeles my
      whole live I always had something to do, however in Syracuse the change of pace was extremely
      different, and the snow always made me want to stay inside when I could. I used this as an opportunity
      to learn the basics of mixing music and got comfortable with the songs I enjoyed. Since my sophomore
      year I have upgraded my equipment with more features to improve my skills and have even been
      offered to play for different organizations and events however I try to stray away from events as I want
      to keep this hobby as a fun escape rather than another job and responsibility. One of my favorite sub genres of dance music is drum and bass. I was first introduced to the genre listening to this group called Worship. Here is one of my favorite sets by them!

    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p>
      As stated on my about me page, I grew up in Los Angeles however for sports I follow a random
      assortment of teams. First, I will discuss my favorite basketball team being the Phoenix Suns. I have
      relatives in the Phoenix area and so I would always go to games growing up. I decided to follow the
      team and become full supporters when I saw Devin Booker play in his rookie year. Another reason for
      picking the suns was that I did not want to be like all my friends who supported a historic team like the
      Lakers. I wanted to be different. I still follow the Phoenix Suns occasionally however it is difficult being
      across the Country and late start times to games. Next ill discuss football which I never watched growing
      up. Los Angeles never had a team when I was young, so it was hard to follow a team. My dad was a
      raiders fan due to him growing up when they were in Los Angeles. I admire how supportive the fans are
      of the team despite the team being horrific for years and decided to start following the team this season
      as I never felt a personal connection to the Rams and Chargers despite them both moving to Los Angeles
      Recently. Lastly is baseball which is easy to explain because I am a supporter of the Dodgers. I grew up
      going to games and have seen ups and downs of the franchise. I know these teams are a weird
      combination, but they all have a connection to me somehow which helps build interest in sports that I
      watch.
