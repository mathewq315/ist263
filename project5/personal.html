    <h2>About me personally</h2>
    <p>
    Although I have displayed my interests of tech, I spend time participating in other activities and would 
    wish to share them with you!</p>

    <h2>Mixing Music</h2>
    <p>
    This was a hobby I picked up my sophomore year of college. I was introduced to the activity when my 
    sister learned the basics while she was in college. I borrowed her equipment over breaks when visiting 
    California. It was hard to understand at first as I did not have any background in music. It was even a 
    little daunting at first with all the buttons, switches, and knobs. I decided to I enjoyed it enough to 
    follow through with the hobby and purchase my own equipment. Living outside of Los Angeles my 
    whole live I always had something to do, however in Syracuse the change of pace was extremely 
    different, and the snow always made me want to stay inside when I could. I used this as an opportunity 
    to learn the basics of mixing music and got comfortable with the songs I enjoyed. Since my sophomore 
    year I have upgraded my equipment with more features to improve my skills and have even been 
    offered to play for different organizations and events however I try to stray away from events as I want 
    to keep this hobby as a fun escape rather than another job and responsibility.

    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p>
    As stated on my about me page, I grew up in Los Angeles however for sports I follow a random 
    assortment of teams. First, I will discuss my favorite basketball team being the Phoenix Suns. I have 
    relatives in the Phoenix area and so I would always go to games growing up. I decided to follow the 
    team and become full supporters when I saw Devin Booker play in his rookie year. Another reason for 
    picking the suns was that I did not want to be like all my friends who supported a historic team like the 
    Lakers. I wanted to be different. I still follow the Phoenix Suns occasionally however it is difficult being 
    across the Country and late start times to games. Next ill discuss football which I never watched growing 
    up. Los Angeles never had a team when I was young, so it was hard to follow a team. My dad was a 
    raiders fan due to him growing up when they were in Los Angeles. I admire how supportive the fans are 
    of the team despite the team being horrific for years and decided to start following the team this season 
    as I never felt a personal connection to the Rams and Chargers despite them both moving to Los Angeles 
    Recently. Lastly is baseball which is easy to explain because I am a supporter of the Dodgers. I grew up 
    going to games and have seen ups and downs of the franchise. I know these teams are a weird 
    combination, but they all have a connection to me somehow which helps build interest in sports that I 
    watch.
