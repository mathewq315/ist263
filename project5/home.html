        <h1>About me:</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Mathew Quintero. I am originally from Monrovia, California. Monrovia, California is 
        about 30 minutes east of Downtown Los Angeles. currently attend Syracuse University. I am currently 
        working towards a Bachelor of Science in Information Management & Technology with concentrations in 
        information security and data science. Through my work at Syracuse University, I have developed a 
        foundation to understand large data sets and solve real world issues using data.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Information Technology?</h2>
        <p>I have always loved technology growing up and knew it was important to have a passion for the industry 
        I would pursue a career in. I have also love problem solving. I enjoy being challenged and taking time to 
        solve the issue step by step. Through my time at Syracuse University, I learned that information is a 
        value resource to solving issues. Through my project which can be found on the following page I learned 
        how important it is to make data driven decisions rather than blindly making choices. Lastly, I decided to 
        follow a career in this field to make an impact. In the future, I am considering going back to school to get 
        a master’s degree in health science. I truly do want to make an impact with my work and believe a great 
        way to participate is within the medical field.
